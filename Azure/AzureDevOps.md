- Once we are happy with the changes we can commit them, leaving a comment helps :

- we can create a pull request before merging into the main branch
- we can edit the pull request so people can review it before merging

- for those reviewing our request they can leave comments and if they are happy they can approve the edit
  and complete the merge
